<h1>DECODING DIGITAL BORDERS</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<BODY>When the news broke that the British government had been deploying a racist algorithm in order to ratify visa applications, thereby discriminating against people from the Global South, the surprise was measured. 
Indeed, the happening fell within a long history of exclusionary migration policy, that has favoured a certain ideal, cosmopolitan type of ‘migrant’ in contrast to the economic, low-skilled migrant constructed as undeserving. Since the London attacks of 2005 the UK has increasingly securitised its borders in both a digital and analogue form.
This culminated in the "UK Home Office hostile environment policy" 2012, charged by the UNHCR as having "fostered xenophobia within the UK”.
Commonly, this was expressed in a hidden form, with policies exploiting structural identifiers. In 2015, in light of the migrant crisis, the UK introduced a points based system Since XXX the points based system has translated into an algorithm, hardening an already present bias and unquestioningly perpetuating the current politics of the UK government.
In light of this development, we consider an investigation into the specific workings of the algorithms to be paramount.
In the following we therefore specify the bias of the algorithm in question according to nationalities and document its perpetuating effect after its deployment, initially contextualizing the role of migration policy, algorithms and their intersection in UK governance. 
Against this qualitative, analytic background we will quantitatively evaluate the outcomes of visa applications to the UK, both before and after implementing the algorithm.</BODY>


<h2>Literature Review and approach</h2>

<BODY>Migration policies generally are intended to retain the integrity of a national political body (Asad, 2003; Mavelli, 2013), defining migrants as either deserving of legal status or not, in accordance to how they prop up the national (Bosworth, 2008). 
In a European (Asad, 2003; Mavelli, 2013) and UK (Capdevila and Callaghan, 2008) context, migrants are therefore often considered to be either dangerous Others against with the nation defines itself, or an economically exploitable resource (with the exception of refugees),
Thus, they are succumb to particularly harsh policies (Bove et al., 2021; Ceccorulli, 2019), which use migrants precarity for cheap labour, perpetuating global inequalities (de León, 2015; Garza, 2018; Mcc. Heyman, 1995). This occurs despite an interest in being meritocratic, rendering this approach crucial for understanding the broader ethics encoded in UK migration policy.
The use of statistically tools such as algorithms in policy have been documented to depoliticize and perpetuate these ethics, by switching the epistemology of government from a potentially political decision to an objective, calculated one (Amoore and Piotukh, 2015; Anders, 2008; Gilbert, 2020).
Moreover, algorithms already have a long history of being unsuccessfully deployed at borders in different formats, however literature on algorithms in visa-decision processes remains sparse (Amoore, 2006; Anderson, 2014; Murphy and Maguire, 2015). Here, there is a great emphasis on how the presence of a ranking or predictive device (which can be an algorithm) are discriminatory, easily evaded, and ultimately inaccurate.
The existence of a technologically securitized border still determines legality and shapes lives. Our investigation builds upon this work, approaching the perpetuative effect of the UK algorithm valuing visa decisions to the UK.
<p>This is not to say the deployment of algorithms in visa granting systems is inherently bad, indeed they are not the only black box present. Government institutions retain an opacity and unpredictability, which is exacerbated due  to their inherent status of power (Mitchell, 2007; Tuckett, 2015). This may be actually rendered more tangible through an algorithm. It is from this nuanced perspective of critique and appreciation for the complex situation at hand, that we seek to decode the bias of the UK visa granting algorithm in an attempt to offer adequate solutions.</p>
