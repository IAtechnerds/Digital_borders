<h1>DECODING DIGITAL BORDERS</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<BODY>When the news broke that the British government had been deploying a racist algorithm in order to ratify visa applications, thereby discriminating against people from the Global South, the surprise was measured. 
Indeed, the happening fell within a long history of exclusionary migration policy, that has favoured a certain ideal, cosmopolitan type of ‘migrant’ in contrast to the economic, low-skilled migrant constructed as undeserving. Since the London attacks of 2005 the UK has increasingly securitised its borders in both a digital and analogue form.
This culminated in the "UK Home Office hostile environment policy" 2012, charged by the UNHCR as having "fostered xenophobia within the UK”.
Commonly, this was expressed in a hidden form, with policies exploiting structural identifiers. In 2015, in light of the migrant crisis, the UK introduced a points based system Since XXX the points based system has translated into an algorithm, hardening an already present bias and unquestioningly perpetuating the current politics of the UK government.
In light of this development, we consider an investigation into the specific workings of the algorithms to be paramount.
In the following we therefore specify the bias of the algorithm in question according to nationalities and document its perpetuating effect after its deployment, initially contextualizing the role of migration policy, algorithms and their intersection in UK governance. 
Against this qualitative, analytic background we will quantitatively evaluate the outcomes of visa applications to the UK, both before and after implementing the algorithm.</BODY>


<h2>Literature Review and approach</h2>

<BODY>Migration policies generally are intended to retain the integrity of a national political body (Asad, 2003; Mavelli, 2013), defining migrants as either deserving of legal status or not, in accordance to how they prop up the national (Bosworth, 2008). 
In a European (Asad, 2003; Mavelli, 2013) and UK (Capdevila and Callaghan, 2008) context, migrants are therefore often considered to be either dangerous Others against with the nation defines itself, or an economically exploitable resource (with the exception of refugees),
Thus, they are succumb to particularly harsh policies (Bove et al., 2021; Ceccorulli, 2019), which use migrants precarity for cheap labour, perpetuating global inequalities (de León, 2015; Garza, 2018; Mcc. Heyman, 1995). This occurs despite an interest in being meritocratic, rendering this approach crucial for understanding the broader ethics encoded in UK migration policy.
The use of statistically tools such as algorithms in policy have been documented to depoliticize and perpetuate these ethics, by switching the epistemology of government from a potentially political decision to an objective, calculated one (Amoore and Piotukh, 2015; Anders, 2008; Gilbert, 2020).
Moreover, algorithms already have a long history of being unsuccessfully deployed at borders in different formats, however literature on algorithms in visa-decision processes remains sparse (Amoore, 2006; Anderson, 2014; Murphy and Maguire, 2015). Here, there is a great emphasis on how the presence of a ranking or predictive device (which can be an algorithm) are discriminatory, easily evaded, and ultimately inaccurate.
The existence of a technologically securitized border still determines legality and shapes lives. Our investigation builds upon this work, approaching the perpetuative effect of the UK algorithm valuing visa decisions to the UK.
<p>This is not to say the deployment of algorithms in visa granting systems is inherently bad, indeed they are not the only black box present. Government institutions retain an opacity and unpredictability, which is exacerbated due  to their inherent status of power (Mitchell, 2007; Tuckett, 2015). This may be actually rendered more tangible through an algorithm. It is from this nuanced perspective of critique and appreciation for the complex situation at hand, that we seek to decode the bias of the UK visa granting algorithm in an attempt to offer adequate solutions.</p>
 
  

  

<h2>Policy</h2>

<BODY> <p>In order to understand the relevance of this study, it is necessary to look at the UK's policies on immigration. Since 2005, a tightening of immigration rules has been implemented. Following various terrorist attacks around the world, such as the 7 July 2005 attack in London, the UK has introduced a system of increased control, including an "e-border programme" to centralise and better share information between intelligence services and the police. This system will make it easier to implement a point based system of visa.
A constant evolution led in 2012 to a tightening of regulations towards a "UK Home Office hostile environment policy" considered by the UNHCR as having "fostered xenophobia within the UK".</p> <BODY> 

  <p>The migration situation in 2015 should also be highlighted. Indeed, many migrants arrived in Europe from sub-Saharan Africa but also from the Balkans and the Middle East. This date also corresponds to that of the implementation of the visa allocation algorithm that we will study. This policy underwent a final evolution towards an increasingly selective immigration system after Brexit, which led the United Kingdom to adopt a policy of a point-based system to select "the most highly skilled workers, skilled workers, students”.
This system implemented in 2021 is the result of a long evolution impacted by international situations that have hardened the policies towards migrants. This hardening, which, as we shall see, has created discrimination between developed countries and less developed countries in situations of instability.</p>
  <p>When the news broke that the British government had been deploying a racist algorithm in order to ratify visa applications, thereby discriminating against people from the Global South, the surprise was measured (CITATION). Indeed the happening fell within a long history of exclusionary migration policy, that has favored a certain ideal, cosmopolitan type of ‘migrant’ in contrast to the economic, low-skilled migrant constructed as undeserving. Such imagery has long since taken on a racialized form, replicating global inequalities emerging from a colonial history.
 Commonly, this was expressed in a hidden form, with policies exploiting structural identifiers such as job or education opportunities, income and skills thereby maintaining global inequalities to the economic and political advantage of the nation concerned. The algorithm deployed however shocked in terms of its blatant ability to perpetuate these inequalities by creating and using a blacklist of nations, which were to be disadvantaged in visa applications.</p>
