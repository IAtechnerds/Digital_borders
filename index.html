<h2>sommaire</h2>
(<BODY> In order to understand the relevance of this study, it is necessary to look at the UK's policies on immigration. Since 2005, a tightening of immigration rules has been implemented. Following various terrorist attacks around the world, such as the 7 July 2005 attack in London, the UK has introduced a system of increased control, including an "e-border programme" to centralise and better share information between intelligence services and the police. This system will make it easier to implement a point based system of visa.
A constant evolution led in 2012 to a tightening of regulations towards a "UK Home Office hostile environment policy" considered by the UNHCR as having "fostered xenophobia within the UK".

The migration situation in 2015 should also be highlighted. Indeed, many migrants arrived in Europe from sub-Saharan Africa but also from the Balkans and the Middle East. This date also corresponds to that of the implementation of the visa allocation algorithm that we will study. This policy underwent a final evolution towards an increasingly selective immigration system after Brexit, which led the United Kingdom to adopt a policy of a point-based system to select "the most highly skilled workers, skilled workers, students‚Äù.
This system implemented in 2021 is the result of a long evolution impacted by international situations that have hardened the policies towards migrants. This hardening, which, as we shall see, has created discrimination between developed countries and less developed countries in situations of instability.
